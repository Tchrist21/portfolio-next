**A captivating opposites-attract lesbian romance about a city woman discovering her country heart.**

Australian country girl Nina Pellegrini runs a program for city kids to experience a taste of rural life at Banksia Farm. But when a child is hurt and a lawsuit threatens, Nina is determined to find the best legal assistance to help her save the farm.

Enter high-flying lawyer Leigh Willoughby, whose city world is far from the farm's chaotic mix of kids and animals. She certainly doesn't have time for small cases that don't pay or farm visits that wreck her cool - and her clothes.

Still, the warm-hearted Nina and her challenging, 12-year-old daughter, Phoebe, are awfully hard to say no to. What on earth has she gotten herself into?
