A na√Øve activist is hired by a corporate villain but doesn't realize it. Cue one awkward farce, a twisty puzzle, and the slowest of slow burns in this opposites-attract, ice queen romance.

Nine years ago, aloof, icy Michelle Hastings chose career over love. She's now living with that choice as she rules a secret corporation catering to the rich and powerful.

Enter Eden Lawless. The guileless activist finds it a bit weird being employed by a mystery organization to bring down a corrupt mayor. But, hey, she's up for a challenge. Much harder is getting her beautiful new boss out of her head. The pull between them is electric.
