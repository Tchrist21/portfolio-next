Corey Curtis is coasting. At 33, she's in the best shape of her life and has a satisfying position at Jackson City Memorial Hospital. With a good paycheck, great friends, and occasional relationships with smart, beautiful women, she couldn't be happier. She thinks.

Dr. Thayer Reynolds, whiling away some time before the start of her Emergency Department fellowship at JCMH and intrigued by the stories she's heard, crashes the morgue to get a look at Corey - the woman her young colleagues are whispering about.

Totally spinning from her first interactions with Thayer, Corey throws herself into the post-mortem exam of a construction worker who fell to his death, which isn't at all suspicious - until it is. With no support from her boss or the police, Corey investigates the death on her own. Making bad decisions with good intentions, she recklessly endangers her own life and Thayer's.
